<h4 align="center">About me</h4>
I'm a young developer. I have been coding for almost a year and learned a lot in the process. I'm currently in high school, but planning to study Software Engineering or Computer Science.  

Apart from coding, I love to play videogames and chat with my friends in Discord. This leads me to my starts in the programming, because I started learning with the objective of create my own Discord bot. At this moment, I'm working on [RoboTito](https://github.com/Ti7oyan/RoboTito) which is my most important project until now.  

Some facts about me:
- 🎶 I **love any kind of music**.
- 🖌 I had a personal entrepeneurship where I was working as a **graphic designer**, at least two years.
- 📱 I'm into **custom Android ROMs world since 2019**.
- 👨‍💻 I had my first (non-voluntaree) coding contact with a Minecraft plugin in 2019, it was a JSON database.
- 👨‍🍳 I **like cooking**.
- 💻 I **love GNU/Linux**, but I keep a Dual-Boot system.
